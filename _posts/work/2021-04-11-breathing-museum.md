[Breathing Museum](https://caleblstone.github.io/systems-aesthetics-final/) is a final project submitted for [Alan Ruiz's](http://www.alanruiz.net/) class on Systems Aesthetics.

The website is the final documentation of a semester-long group project aiming introduce students to both [institutional critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Critique) and critical group [psychodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics). Groups organized themselves into "affinity groups" that centered around particular cultural insitutions within New York City and were tasked with conducting fieldwork concerning their institution's boundary conditions. Additionally, groups were expected to look inwards and conduct recursive research on how the study of the institution influenced the boundary conditions within the group itself. 

Leveraging shifting boundaries, blurry layers, and disorienting color fades, I designed and built the website to reflect the particular experiences of our group. The boundary surrounding the site content is set to undulate at the [rate of the average human breath](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vital-signs-body-temperature-pulse-rate-respiration-rate-blood-pressure) . As the cursor traveres a section plan of [The New Museum](https://www.newmuseum.org/), the boundary accelerates or slows in relation to our group's surveyed anxiety levels in the corresponding environments. This boundary is also designed to sometimes include, sometimes exclude, the button linking the the section on our internal group dynamics, reflecting the way in which the museum's involvement in our internal conflict varied over time.
