[Artists and Hackers](https://www.artistsandhackers.org/) is a podcast dedicated to the community that is building and using new digital tools for creation.

The podcast interviews programmers, artists, poets, musician, bot-makers, educators, students, and designers in an effort to critically look at both online artmaking and the history of technology and the internet. The pocast’s website serves to both host the podcast and provide a central hub through which interested individuals can find new tools to learn and integrate into their own practices.

In an attempt to replicate the project of the podcast, to humanize and materialize a topic often considered inaccessible, the [website](https://www.artistsandhackers.org/) and [social media posts](https://www.instagram.com/artistsandhackers/) follow an organic and familiar visual language, creating a friendly environment for listeners to learn and ask questions.
